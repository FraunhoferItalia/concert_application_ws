# Concert Mission Generator

Authors: [Michael Terzer](michael.terzer@fraunhofer.it) Fraunhofer Italia 2022-2024

This package is used in combination with the tools from the concert_application_ws to create missions in form of behavior trees to be sent to a behavior tree executor of the 

[behavior_tree_stack](https://github.com/FraunhoferItalia/behavior_tree_stack). [Interactive markers](https://github.com/ros-visualization/interactive_markers) are used to enable users of an RViz visualization to configure and parametrize robotic missions in the context with the [CONCERT](https://concertproject.eu/) project.

For indications how to run, consult concert_application_ws.
