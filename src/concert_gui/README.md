# Concert Graphical User Interface

Authors: [Simone Garbin](simone.garbin@fraunhofer.it) Fraunhofer Italia 2023-2024

This package provides a Graphical User Interface to use the Concert platform and simplify the completion of various tasks. The GUI is composed of [rqt](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Intermediate/About-RQt.html) embedded windows.  
The interface is divided into tabs that allow a non-expert user to view the robot's parameters, perform tasks, monitor the visualization of the environment through the robots'camera and monitor and edit behavior trees with Groot. 


# Installation and usage

This package is used in combination with the tools from the concert_application_ws (in particular with the concert_mission_generator) to display information on the robot's status and to interact with it.

For more information on the individual tabs, see the corresponding packages.

For indications how to run, consult concert_application_ws.
