The user has the option of changing the wall to be drilled via the button.

Then the user can rotate the marker or translate it with the appropriate buttons.

Finally, the user can start the mission with the **Dispatch Mission** button, perform the **Next** operation or **Stop** the current mission.

It is also possible, with the appropriate buttons, to change the view to have a default view, a marker focus or a top-view.
